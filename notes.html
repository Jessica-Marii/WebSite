							<h2>Computer Build Notes</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<h1>Mother Board:</h1>
							<u>Integrated</u>- all parts are connected but still has a few expansion slots (non removable graphics card) </br>
							<u>Non-integrated</u>- only expansion slots (removable graphics card)</br>
							<u>Server boards</u>- handles storing data, processing speeds 
							<ul>
							<li>Socket platform</li>
							<li>Chipset</li>
							<li>LAN controllers</li>
							<li>Server management</li>
							<li>Integrated manageability</li></ul>
							<u>Form Factor</u>- size of the board ATX(12 x 9.6 in) MicroATX(9.6 x 9.6 in) minATX(6.7 x 6.7)</br>
							<u>Chipset</u>- processors CPU (Intel core i9-9000k 3.6 GHz 8-core Processor) </br>
							<u>Expansion slots</u>- PCI or express, crossfire, video cards</br>
							<u>Ports</u>- USB (3.1 Type C), HDMI (2.0 4K), display port (144hz), Ethernet</br>
							<u>Dual-Channel Technology</u>- allows you to multiply throughput twofold (RAM)</br>
							<u>RAID Support</u>- Allows data to be stored across multiple hard drives </br>
							<ul><li> RAID 1 setup consists of at least two drives that are mirrored to contain the exact same information</li>
							<li>RAID 5 uses a combination of striping and parity that is distributed across drives</li>
							<li> RAID 6 in a four-drive setup you lose half of your storage space for parity, though your data will still be intact in the event of simultaneously losing two drives</li>
							<li> RAID 10 (also known as RAID 1+0) is best suited for four drives. Instead of relying on either mirroring or striping, it actually involves both, hence the 1+0. Data is essentially 
							striped between two sets of mirrored disks, creating a system that can handle a single drive failure in either set of drives or a simultaneous drive failure in both sets. What it cannot deal 
							with is a simultaneous drive failure of one set.</li></ul>
						
						<hr/>
						<h1>CPU:</h1>
						<ul><li>performs calculations, actions, and runs programs. (fetch from RAM, decode, and execute)</li>
						<li>(dual, quad, or even octo)-core processor for example is really just two separate CPUs on a single chip. By increasing the amount of cores, CPUs are able to handle multiple processes 
							simultaneously. This had the desired effect of increasing performance and reducing processing time.</li></ul>
						<u>Prefixes:</u>
						<ul><li>Mobile processor prefixes have “U” for ultra-low power, “HQ” for high performance graphics, and “HK” for high performance graphics with the ability to overclock. </li>
						<li>Desktop prefixes include “K” for ability to overclock,and “T” for optimized power.</li></ul>
						<u>Bandwidth</u> - Allows so many bits to be set and processed to the CPU at a time (64 or 32 bit's) </br>
						<u>Thermal Power Design</u>-  is a measure of maximum power in Watts your CPU will consume.</br>
						<u>L2/L3 Cache</u>- this will control how fast the CPU can process</br>
						<u>Frequency</u>-  refers to the operating speed of the processor.</br>
						<u>Core Clock </u>- is how fast the computer can run</br>
						<u>Boost Clock</u>- is the fastest the computer can run
						<hr/>
						<h1>CPU Cooler:</h1>
						<u>Air:</u></br>
						<ul><li>Metal heatsinks and fans, come in all shapes and sizes and varying thermal dissipation capacities (usually listed as TDP).</li>
						<li>Can be larger in size with limited cooling</li></ul>
						<u>Closed -loop(AIO):</u></br>
						<ul><li>Liquid</li>
						<li>Can be (but aren’t always) quieter than air coolers</li>
						<li>Can have an easier fit</li></ul>
						<hr/>
						<h1>Space & Power:</h1>
						<u>Storage</u>
						<ul><li>When looking for storage you will have to see what will phyically fit the build. Also you need to decide to use a RAID setup. RAID are typically not used for home PC's.</li>
						<li>For the best performance it is ideal to get the same brand SSD or hard drive if having multiple in the PC.</li></ul>
						<u>Memory(RAM)</u> - 32 gb and up is ideal for a gaming computer match pin count to the mother board</br>
						<u>Power Supply</u>- If you  wish to add more expansion cards in the future, I would recommend getting a higher wattage power supply for any adjustments later in the future.
